# hello-world

Once upon a time, there was nothing. Wait, that's not correct... 
Since there was nothing, there could not have been time...
And what do we mean by 'there was'?

So let's start again, but this time let us try to be more precise.

Nothing.

This is kinda boring. But if we add just one notion to nothing, we get something, which leads naturally to everything! That one notion is that of a set. We consider the set of Nothing:

{Nothing}.

Still boring. But then, we can have this:

{Nothing, {Nothing} }.

Now we're getting somewhere! By nesting this, we get a counting system - the set of Natural numbers. From this we can easily construct rational numbers, and even reals. Then follow complex numbers, quaternions, octonions etc. 

But this is still only math, you say. 

Well... Yes.

But it turns out that you only need this math to describe the whole of Standard Model of particle physics, see for example https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09182.pdf for the construction from just the above. If you don't like it, the notion of a set leads naturally to that of a group and also to vector spaces. From there, you get the usual story of physics.

The only thing missing here is GRAVITY...
